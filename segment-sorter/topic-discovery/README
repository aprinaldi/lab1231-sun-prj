Goal:
> construct an LDA model from a given corpus (as training data)

Steps:
> determine a set of training data $D_{tr} = {img_i}$
> extract Affine Covariant Regions and their descriptor of all images in $D_{tr}$, see http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/

> determine the number of word clusters K
> cluster/quantize the noisy-words into a set of K word clusters

> determine the set of topics $Z$; a topic is an object-class
> determine the alpha, beta params for LDA
> run the LDA model generator, e.g. GibbsLDA++

> evaluate the learnt LDA model: to segments(=docs) for a topic, segment ranking w.r.t to a topic from multiple segmentation on an image
