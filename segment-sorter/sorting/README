Goal:
Given a test image $img$, produce a set of good segments.
We hypothesize that good segments contain a single topic (= object class) with high probability/confidence.
Eventually, those good segments are used in MRF-based (hi-order) semantic segmentation.

Steps:
> extract Affine Covariant Regions of $img$, see http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/
> for each region, compute the region descriptor, see http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/
> for each region, determine which word it belongs based on the raw-word quantization performed in the topic-discovery phase
> do multiple segmentation on $img$
> for each segment on $img$, compute P(w|t), i.e. a histogram that indicates the (normalized) frequency of each word contained in this segment
> for each segment, determine its goodness score $s$, i.e. $s = min_z diff( P(w|z),P*(w|z) )$, where $P*(w|t)$ is obtained in the topic-discovery phase
> rank segments based on their goodness score
