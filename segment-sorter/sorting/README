Goal:
Given a test image $img$, produce a rank of good segments.
We hypothesize that good segments contain a topic (= object class) with high probability/confidence.
Eventually, those good segments are used in MRF-based (hi-order) semantic segmentation.

Steps:
> extract Affine Covariant Regions and their descritor of $img$, see http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/
> for each region (=(noisy)word), determine which word-cluster it belongs based on the clustering model trained in the topic-discovery phase
> do multiple segmentation on $img$

> for each segment on $img$, compute P(w|d), i.e. a histogram that indicates the (normalized) frequency of each word contained in this segment
> for each segment, determine its goodness score $s$, i.e. $s = min_z diff( P(w|z),P*(w|z) )$, where $P*(w|t)$ is from the learnt LDA model

> alternatively, do inference with the learnt LDA model on the corpus extracted from test image 
> compute the goodness score $s = max_t P(t|d) $

> rank segments based on their goodness score
